  * Create a task
  * Delete a task
  * Update a task
  * Mark a task complete

Your code must meet the following requirements:
  * Core app logic must be encapsulated using classes.
  * Your project files should be organized into folders according to their purpose.
  * For recurring parts of your UI (HTML), you should use EJS partials (`include`).
  * Generally, code should be clean and well-organize. (ESLint is highly encourage.)
